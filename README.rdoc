== DESCRIPTION:

* Ragweed is a set of scriptable debugging tools written mostly in native ruby.

* Where required the Ruby/DL and Win32API libraries are used to interface the machine
  and OS native system calls.

== Supported Platforms

Ragweed is supported and has been tested on the following platforms (32bit intel only):

  Windows 7
  Windows XP
  Linux Ubuntu 10.4
  Linux Ubuntu 9.10
  Mac OS X 10.6
  Mac OS X 10.5

At this time only Ruby 1.8.x has been tested. We are actively investigating both 64 bit
support for each platform and support for Ruby 1.9.x. Unfortunately, both of these things
require significant changes to Ragweed.
    
== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* This suite is currently fairly piecemeal. Each OS has it's own set of tools.
  The most complete set is for Win32.

* Work is ongoing to complete and unify the OSX and Linux portions.
* Struct's Nerve[http://github.com/struct/Nerve] is an example of the API we are heading toward

== SYNOPSIS:

  require 'debuggerosx'
  d = Debuggerosx.new(514) # pid of process to trace

Please see the examples directory for more. There are hit tracers for each platform.

== REQUIREMENTS:

* NONE - no really, this is pure ruby hooking native system libraries. There are no other dependencies, none.

== INSTALL:

  sudo gem install ragweed
  # relax with a tasty beverage, you're done
